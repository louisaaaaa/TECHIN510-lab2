Repository for MSTI course 510 lab2 

## Goal
Create a web app that reads a dataset and displays interesting data visualizations about the dataset

## How to Run
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Lessons Learned
- Learned how to use read data from a CSV file using Pandas
- Learned how to use selectbox and slider components in Streamlit to filter data
- Learned how show charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Questions / Uncertainties
- How can I make the data visualizations more informative and engaging?
- How can I improve the user interface of the web app?
- What kinds of analytical methods can I use to further explore the data?
